                <p>The vegetable also has high levels of natural antioxidants (polyphenols) and glucosinolates and produces sulforaphanes.

                <p>Greek yogurt is filled with sickness-fighting probiotics and is packed with more protein than regular yogurt.

The researchers discovered that people who ate probiotics daily had a lower risk of catching a cold than those who did not eat any probiotic-rich food.</p>

                <p>Blueberries are filled with antioxidants that can help treat and prevent coughs and colds. According to research conducted by the University of Auckland, consuming flavonoids — a class of antioxidants found in blueberries — made adults 33 percent less likely to catch a cold than those who did not eat flavonoid-rich foods or supplements daily.</p>
